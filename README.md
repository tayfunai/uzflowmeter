# UzFlowMeter
UzFlowMeter is a high-performance internet traffic capture tool designed to process more than 10 Gbps of network traffic per second. It is based on the logic of the CICFlowMeter, a tool initially developed in Python, but UzFlowMeter has been optimized for performance using the C programming language and the libpcap library.
